# Queue-Based-Story-Generation
  This is a queue based story generator in progress. The algorithm is based off a talk Elan Ruskin gave at GDC 2012 on behalf of  Valve.( http://gdcvault.com/play/1015528/AI-driven-Dynamic-Dialog-through)
  Next I will modify the algorithm to work more like the agent based dutch project, the Virtual StoryTeller, with separate actors communicating independently with a world and plot agent. (http://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~theune/VS/)
